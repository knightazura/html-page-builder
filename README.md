Simple app that used to create website or HTML layout using graphical user interface (do you know Squarespace?).

### A little bit history, not a reason
Built on Vue, this app initially was on my planning list of "Frontend Portofolio". Just like most people, it just sit there until I forced to do that.

Besides, I'm also use this opportunity to sharpen my skill on Vue 3 (and Typescript in the future) Insha Allah.

### Demo
